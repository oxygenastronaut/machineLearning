# GD6imageClassifer.py

# train an image classifer using tensor flow for poets

# tensor flow is especially good for deep learning like image classification

# no feature engineering is necessary

# the tensor flow is essentially applying a function (the classifier) onto a 2d array of images
# then it spits out the label as the output of the function

# with this deep learning, the classifier used will be a neural network
